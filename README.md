# AI-Enhanced-Virtual-Training-Platform-for-Emergency-Response-in-Disaster-Management

### Project Overview
This project focuses on the development of an AI-enhanced virtual training platform that combines virtual scenarios and interactive elements inspired by educational escape rooms to simulate disaster management emergencies. The platform will be designed to train emergency response teams, including first responders, medical personnel, and disaster management coordinators, in handling complex, high-pressure situations such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks, or large-scale accidents.

Participants in the training will engage in virtual scenarios where they must make critical decisions, manage resources, and coordinate with other team members. The platform will collect multimodal data from various sources (e.g., physiological sensors, decision logs, and communication transcripts) to analyze the decision-making process and identify key factors that contribute to effective response strategies.

The project will involve the latest advancements in temporal learning analytics and explainable AI to understand and enhance the decision-making process. This highly interdisciplinary project lies at the intersection of computing, emergency management, psychology, and AI.

### Project Goals
1. Realistic Training Simulations: Develop an immersive virtual environment that replicates real-world disaster scenarios, allowing participants to practice emergency response strategies.
2. Multimodal Data Collection: Integrate physiological sensors, decision logs, and communication analysis to collect data on participant responses during training scenarios.
3. Temporal Learning Analytics: Apply advanced temporal learning analytics to analyze the decision-making process over time, identifying patterns and key decision points.
4. Explainable AI: Utilize explainable AI techniques to map the decision-making process and provide feedback to participants, helping them understand the factors that led to successful outcomes.
5. Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Foster collaboration across computing, emergency management, psychology, and AI to create a comprehensive and effective training tool.

### Project Structure
The project will be divided into several modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of the system:

1. virtual_scenario_generator.py: Creates and manages the virtual disaster scenarios, including dynamic event generation and participant interactions.
2. data_collection_module.py: Handles the collection of multimodal data from physiological sensors, decision logs, and communication transcripts.
3. temporal_analysis.py: Implements temporal learning analytics to analyze the decision-making process over time.
4. explainable_ai_module.py: Applies explainable AI techniques to map the decision-making process and generate feedback for participants.
5. user_interface.py: Provides an interactive interface for participants to engage with the virtual scenarios and receive feedback.
